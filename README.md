## G'day, I'm Duhon

No, it's not my real name. I generally don't share too much online, even though I kinda go against that rule by writting a Readme at all.  

Here is my description:

- I have been coding for about 7 years, though the date is uncertain.
- I live in Brazil, even though my preferred language is English instead of Portuguese.
- I code as a side gig, but I sill want to one day make this more of a full time thing.  

The languages I generally code with are Python and sometimes Java, since they are the ones I am most confortable with. My favorite projects are the following:  

1. [RPG Generator](https://github.com/DuhonTheGuy/RPG-Generator)
2. That's it
3. For real I don't have any more favorites
