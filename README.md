## G'day, I'm Duhon

No, it's not my real name. I generally don't share too much online, even though I kinda go against that rule by writting a Readme at all.  

Here is my description:

- I have been coding since about 2014, though the date is uncertain.
- I live in Brazil, even though my preferred language is English instead of Portuguese.
- I am a Computer Science student.

The languages I generally code with are Python and sometimes C, since they are the ones I am most comfortable with.
